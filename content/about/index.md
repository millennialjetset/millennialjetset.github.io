**Millennial Jet Set** aims to periodically serve up articles for our generation that run the gamut from serious thought-pieces to light-hearted guides, on topics including politics, arts, culture, food, among others - all imbued with sardonic humor and meant to be read half-heartedly and a good sense of fun.

## About the author

Rachel is a 30-something sometimes world traveler, elder millennial, and mother to a geriatic grehound and very rambunctious cat. She has absolutely no background or education in journalism or journalism-adjacent. This not her day job.
