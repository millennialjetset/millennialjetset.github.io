Welcome to **Millennial Jet Set**, the online home of the *existentially stateless*. 

## About

**Millennial Jet Set** aims to periodically serve up articles for the *existentially stateless* that run the gamut from serious thought-pieces to light-hearted guides, on topics including politics, arts, culture, food, among others - all imbued with sardonic humor and meant to be read half-heartedly and a good sense of fun.

### Trash and No Star

What is *existential statelessness*? It is that feeling that you do not belong to a singular place or country, but being inevitably bound to a location that doesn't feel like home due to laws, obligations, norms, fears, money, and a certain virus that shall not be named. It is belonging everywhere at once but nowhere having a home. The existentially stateless are in a state of flux; they need a place to call home, but are unable to find it.

But the *existentially stateless* don't allow this state of being to define themselves in a negative fashion - they are not woeful. On the contrary, they see the humor, the irony in their condition. They will seek to transcend their condition: by learning new languages, immersing themselves in news and cultures from the opposite side of the world, travel, and, if they're successful, find their place. **Millennial Jet Set** simultaneously serves as aresource, a waypoint, and a guide to the *existentially stateless* in their pursuit of a home.

I hope you enjoy my articles, but please remember to take everything with a grain of salt.

## About the author

Rachel is a 30-something sometimes world traveler and self-proclaimed and premier member of the existentially stateless class. She was inspired to start this blog to find other similar individuals and to reassure her that she isn't the only person who feels this way. because she hates doing things by herself.

Rachel presently resides on planet Earth with her geriatic grehound and very rambunctious cat. She has absolutely no background or education in journalism or journalism-adjacent. This not her day job.
