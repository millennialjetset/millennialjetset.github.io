[{"content":"This topic is going to delve into something that has been part of my state of mind of late. It is what I call existential placelessness. This may be more esoteric and personal, but I will operate under the assumption that there are some people out there that feel the same way, mostly because I hate being the only one that does or feels something.\nThe place-site discordance To understand what means to be existentially placeless, we need to establish certain operative definitions. Most crucially, we need to establish the difference between place and site. While both refer to physical locations, and both terms may refer to one’s city, region, or country, they are qualitatively different: site is quite simply the location at which one resides on more or less a permanent basis; by contrast, place is the location one feels belonging, kinship, and a figurative sense of citizenship. In short, a site is where one lives; a place is one’s home.\nPlace and site are not inherently mutually exclusive. Place-site concordance, that is, feeling kinship with the location in which you live, is possibly the majority condition. When there is no concordance between the two, a place-site discordance inevitably exists. A single person may be both place and site concordant and discondordant given that location can refer to varying categories. One might feel out of place in their city but have kinship with their country.\nIn the presence of a place-site discordance, three possible conditions: placelessness, sitelessness, and the null condition exist.\n  Placelessness is the condition in which one has a site but lacks a place. In other words, a placeless individual has more or less a permanent residence - a location in which one lives, yet they lack kinship with this location. It is not their place. Their place of kinship is where they will go to. They find a home. This home may have a name, but it may not. It may simply be “somewhere else.”\n  Those who are siteless, by contrast, possess a location they call home, their place, but exist in a condition of temporary to protracted displacement. Their place of kinship is where they will come back to.\n  The null condition is thus an absence of both place and site. This condition is present in individuals of semi-permanent itineracy. They lack both permanent residence in a location and nowhere have a sense of kinship.\n  The existential factor When faced with the conditions present within the place-site discordance, a sense of angst may arise. That is, one who identifies a place-site discordance within themselves may question their present state of being and develop feelings of deep discomfort or malaise with their reality. To be existentially placeless is to recognize that one does not belong in their current physical location, their site, yet simultaneously feel bound to it. They desire a place, their place of kinship, whether actual or idealized, that they cannot claim as a home to go back to. They are presently unable to realize this desire, due to either external factors: law, obligations, financial reasons, social norms and expectations, and of course the recent pandemic; or internal factors, such as fears or self-doubt. It is belonging elsewhere but here. The existentially placeless are in a state of uncomfortable flux; they sense their lack of figurative citizenship to a place – their placelessness.\nThis existential malaise may exist in other conditions. One might be existentially siteless if they express homesickness. Those with the null condition may grow weary of their itineracy and feel the need to settle down, regardless of where. Additionally, place-site discordance is not necessarily existential. There are those who are indifferent to the discordance, and there are those who have no desire to go back to, or find a place.\nThe formation of existential placelessness Existential placelessness is of course not universal, and it is not a natural or inevitible condition. Placelessnes starts from an initial state of place-site concordance. and is disrupted in a two-step process.\nThe erosion of place from site The erosion of place refers to the process by which one loses the sense of kinship to their current location of residence. This lies in contrast to sitelessness, where such erosion never occurs, and instead site dissociates from place due to external factors. With placelessness, either external or internal factors may contribute. Internal factors may simply be due to factors such as cultural or political incompatibility. Alternatively, it can be due to external factors, such as violence or threat of violence and not being made to feel welcome. What kind of home will not have you in it? Such external factors may contribute to this erosion in individuals who are part of a racial or ethnic minority, or members of the LGBTQ community, in which the site that they reside is downright hostile to their existence. One should be forgiven for seeking home elsewhere. In these circumstances, it requires a very intrepid individual to assert their home without moving.\nThis discussion is not complete without mention of the pandemic Zeitgeist, which may contribute to such erosion in some individuals. The processes of isolation and separation are so disruptive to an individual’s status quo that when a sense of normalcy finally returns, what is normal may no longer seem familiar. Home is somewhere one feels kinship - where one feels a sense of comfort. Was one’s comfort in their home, lives, goals, ambitions instead comfort with routine?\nThe elevation of place The elevation of place is process of forming an alternative or desired location in one’s mind. This may be a real location or may be an abstract “somewhere else”. This place may reflect one’s cultural interest, a matter of personal compatibility (such of urban versus rural preferences), or a place of acceptance.\nResolution of the existential factor The existentially placeless have two avenues to resolve their existential malaise: 1) their place-site discordance may cease being existential; and 2) place and site become concordant. The former occurs when the discordance is no longer a source of distress. This can arise from having a newfound sense of indifference to their circumstances. This does not always mean the discordance becomes less important, although it can certainly mean that. Paradoxically, emphasizing the distinction between place and site may relieve the existential malaise. As an example, one might vacation to their place, learn the language of the locals, and immerse themselves in the arts and culture from their perch of their site. The distinction between the two is still present and important, but these actions may be adequate to relieve the existential factor and allow them to be content and comfortable in their condition.\nActions such as these are not adequate for some, though. For them, only the resolution of their condition, their discordance, and the merging of place and site, that is, having place-site concordance, is necessary. These individuals feel such kinship to a place that they relocate there. While this is the path that they must take to resolve their existential malaise, relocation to their imagined home does not imply or guarantee success. There is a danger, where one has idealized their place beyond actual reality, that when they finally do relocate, they discover that reality is so far removed from their idealized image, that they feel more lost than before as they are still without a home. Their existential factor is reinforced, and they have neither site nor place. They have the null condition and still desire a home, but now have no sense of what or where home is, or even how to find it. Their existential malaise is worse than before, as they previously had a place which offered a form of hope. Alternatively, those who are more likely to be successful have a fundamental contradiction: they possess an inherently ideal sense of place, but are more grounded in the reality of what their idea of home can offer them - no place is a utopia, and relocation is not a panacea. They are prepared to be disappointed, because a home, even in the best of times, can be disappointing.\nFinal thoughts Existential placelessness is neither universal nor inevitable. Its causes are as varied as the people who experience this condition; what unites them is a desire for a place of kinship. The process of overcoming that sense of discomfort, by finding their home, is challenging given the inherent hurdles to relocation and is fraught with the danger of exessive idealism of their place beyond reality. But those who seek their place and temper their idealism may be successful. They will have overcome their existential crisis, as they would finally have a place to call home.\n█\n","permalink":"https://millennialjetset.com/posts/existentialplacelessness/","summary":"This topic is going to delve into something that has been part of my state of mind of late.
